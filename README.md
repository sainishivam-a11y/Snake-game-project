# Snake-game-project
Overview
The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen. The goal is to eat food items (often represented as dots or squares), which causes the snake to grow longer. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls. This project is an implementation of the Snake Game using Python and the Pygame library.

Features
Classic Snake Gameplay: The snake moves across the screen, eating food and growing longer.
Game Over Conditions: The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the game boundary.
Score Tracking: The score increases as the snake eats food, and the score is displayed on the screen.
Speed Increase: As the snake eats more food, its speed increases, making the game progressively harder.
Game Restart Option: After the game ends, the player can choose to restart the game.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.
Pygame library to run the game.
Installing Pygame
To install Pygame, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

bash
Copy code
pip install pygame
Setup and Running the Game
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-game.git
Navigate into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd snake-game
Install the required dependencies (if you haven't already):

bash
Copy code
pip install pygame
Run the game script:

bash
Copy code
python snake_game.py
Controls
Arrow Keys: Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the direction of the snake.
Q: Press 'Q' to quit the game at any time during gameplay.
R: Press 'R' to restart the game after it ends.
Game Rules
The snake moves continuously in the chosen direction until the player changes it.
Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, and the score increases.
If the snake hits the wall or collides with itself, the game ends.
The game difficulty increases as the snake eats more food (the snake moves faster).

snake_game.py
This is the main file that contains the logic for the Snake Game. It uses the Pygame library to create the graphical interface, handle user input, and manage the game state.

assets/
This folder contains any image or sprite assets used in the game (optional). If you don’t want to use images, the game will still function with default colors.
